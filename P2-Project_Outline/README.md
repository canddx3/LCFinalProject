## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My Project will be a MEAN ecommerce site for mountain bikes.  I'm wanting to make a sight where people can come look and buy mountain bikes from various manufactures at various price points.  I think this will help users be able to compare different mountain bikes from different manufactures alot easier then switching websites by having the descriptions of each bike all on the same page. I idea is because I like mountain bikes and the pricing, parts, and descriptions are hard to navigate.
